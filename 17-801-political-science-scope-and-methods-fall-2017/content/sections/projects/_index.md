There are three main objectives in this assignment:

*   Determine which variables correlate most with vote share in Cuba.
*   Determine what variables correlate most with Mexican’s ratings of candidates.

Working with the TAs, prepare and present the results of your group project in a 10-minute presentation. You will be strictly timed, and you should make use of visual aids. Your PowerPoint slides should be submitted to the Instructor by 4 PM the day before class.
